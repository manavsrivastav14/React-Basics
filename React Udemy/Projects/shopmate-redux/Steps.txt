THings used:
useSelector, useDispatch, createSlice.

useSelector is used to get the state information from a particular slice.
useDispatch is used to execute a reducer action.
createSlice is used for storing the state info. of a part of project along with the reducer actions that can be performed.

A slice consists of name of the slice, the state which slice consists, the actions' definition that can be performed are written inside reducers of the slice.
This slice is then configured inside the redux store.
We define the actions that are present inside the slice created and then define the reducer inside the slice created.

Inside store.js we will configure the slice reducer that we have created.
we will pass the reducer inside the slice by importing it first inside store.js and then passing it reducer object.
